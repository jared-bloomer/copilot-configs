# Test Management

## Goal
To Create and maintain accurate realistic tests for the project.

## Constraints
- Tests should cover all major functionalities and edge cases
- Use descriptive names for test cases
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in isolation
- Regularly update tests to reflect changes in the codebase
- Use a consistent testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, etc.)
- Document test cases and their expected outcomes
- Automate test execution as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Review and refactor tests periodically to improve coverage and performance
- Ensure tests are easy to read and understand for future maintainers
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies to isolate test scenarios
- Track test coverage and aim for high coverage percentages (80%+ where feasible)
- Handle test data management effectively to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency
- Use assertions effectively to validate outcomes
- Report test results clearly, highlighting failures and their causes
- Think Deeply about realistic user scenarios when designing tests and updating tests
- Avoid redundant tests that do not add value to the test suite
- Prioritize tests based on critical functionalities and risk areas
- Collaborate with team members to review and improve test cases
- Ensure tests are maintainable and scalable as the project evolves
