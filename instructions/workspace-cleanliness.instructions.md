# Workspace Cleanliness

## Goal
To keep the workspace clean and Tidy

## Constraints
- Keep the workspace free of unnecessary items
- Organize code and files logically
- Regularly clean workspace to remove duplication
- Keep all ad-hoc scripts and test files in a separate folder named `sandbox` or `temp`
- Ensure all files are named descriptively and consistently
- DO Not create "extended" files when an existing file for that functionality exists
- Archive old projects and files that are no longer in use but may be needed later
- Use version control effectively to manage changes and keep the workspace organized
